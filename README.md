# WeatherQInfo
weather tool

## Intro

This is my continuous work in progress app which I have started at the end of Android App Development course.
The app is open for the new ideas and improvements; it is kind of reminder for me to keep learning and improve further.


## Main Views

1. Current Weather Info _Long press on weather info shows more details_
2. Weather forecast for the next seven days _Long press on weather info shows more details_
3. Current location weather info
4. Weather map


## Options

1. Add new location/city
2. View and manage all saved locations
3. Remove all data
4. Remove stored weather data
5. View Info screen
6. API key dialog

Currently there is no limit for maximum number of locations, but beware of your openweathermap.org data plan and allowed number of api calls per minute/day/month/â€¦
However, the app tends to make API calls as rarely as possible while still providing the valid information to the user.


**What have I learned so far** (I hope so):

1. Do not hardcode API keys in published code
